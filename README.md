# What's the Problem?

A large portion of our global population are affected by one or more mental disorders. If we can support those who are in distress, we may move towards providing professional care and resources and, hopefully, ultimately reduce the suicide rate and improve quality of life. This project is centered on the third SDG goals: *Good Health and Well-Being*.

## Statistics
According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/):
- Depression affects over 264 million people
- 800,000 people die from suicide annually
- Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young adults

## Our Solution

We aim to support those who are in distress by proving a user-focused mental health app. Our solution is primarily targeted at those who often have and use their mobile phones. Our app aims to aid by providing a sense of mindfulness. We ask the user to complete a daily questionnaire that asks the user questions about their mood, anxiety, and other aspects of their life. With the data collected, we offer a week's glance of the user's mood as well as analytics. The analytics offers views of trends found within the data.

We may find that on days a user goes to classes, they experience the most anxiety. On days the user skips breakfast, their mood is often worse. We hope that by offering these insights to the user, they take a moment to reflect on these trends and consider actions they may take to improve their mental health.

### How Is This App Different Than Others?
- Open Source -- Anyone is able view and contribute to the source code
- Customizable -- Questionnaire is customizable to be tailored to the user
- Serverless -- Your data stays completely local and secured

### Technology
Our application is written within React Native, allowing for maximal portability between devices.
